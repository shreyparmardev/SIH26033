An enterprise-grade, full-stack agricultural marketplace platform connecting **Smallholder Farmers**, **Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs)**, and **Commercial / Retail Buyers** directly. By combining **direct multi-seller commerce**, **FPO bulk demand aggregation**, **AI-driven price intelligence**, and **transparent logistics tracking**, the platform disintermediates conventional supply chains—increasing farmer price realization from ~25–35% up to **80–85% of net end-value**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Solution

### The Conventional Agricultural Challenge
In traditional agricultural supply chains, produce passes through 4 to 6 intermediary layers between the farm gate and consumers:
```
[Traditional Intermediated Chain]
Farmer ──> Village Aggregator ──> Mandi Commission Broker ──> Wholesaler ──> Secondary Wholesaler ──> Retailer ──> Consumer
(Farmer realizes ~25% to 35% of retail price; high post-harvest loss; zero price discovery transparency)
```
Intermediary markups, unregulated mandi commissions (6%+), unverified weighing deductions, and opaque auctions leave farmers vulnerable to distress selling while inflating prices for institutional and retail buyers.

### The SIH26033 Direct Architecture
```
[SIH26033 Digital Architecture]
Farmer / FPO ──────────────────────────────────────────> Verified Institutional & Retail Buyer
                  ▲                               ▲
                  │                               │
         AI Price Intelligence         Direct Multi-Seller Logistics
    (Farmer realizes up to 80-85% of net end-value; transparent fees)
```
- **Direct Trade**: Farmers sell directly to buyers with transparent transport and packaging fees.
- **FPO Bulk Aggregation**: Smallholder harvests are aggregated into commercial truckloads to satisfy institutional purchase requests (RFQs).
- **AI Decision Intelligence**: Machine learning forecasts APMC modal prices, predicts wholesale arrival liquidity, and advises farmers whether to *Sell Now* or *Store*.
- **Fair Settlement Waterfall**: Automatically deducts approved operational fees and disburses net proceeds proportionally to participating farmers.

## ⚡ Implemented Core Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Role Authentication & Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforces distinct authorization scopes across `FARMER`, `FPO`, `BUYER`, and `ADMIN`.
- **Security Engineering**: Password hashing via **Argon2**, stateless JSON Web Tokens (**JWT**) with role claims, Passport guards, and automated session validation.
- **1-Click Demo Sign-in**: Quick demo authentication buttons on `/login` allowing evaluators to immediately log in as Farmer, FPO Manager, or Buyer.

### 2. Marketplace Discovery & Catalog
- **Multi-Parametric Search & Filter**: Real-time filtering by category, search keywords, origin state/district, and dynamic price boundaries (`minPrice` / `maxPrice`).
- **Produce Showcase**: Rich listings featuring real agricultural photography, harvest dates, grade classifications, stock availability, and producer verification badges.
- **Mandi Price Benchmarking**: Side-by-side display of official APMC mandi benchmark prices against platform prices to establish value transparency.

### 3. Cart & Atomic Multi-Seller Order Splitting
- **Database-Backed Cart**: Persistent cart state tied to buyer profiles with real-time inventory validation.
- **Multi-Vendor Order Partitioning**: When a buyer checks out with produce from multiple farmers/FPOs, the checkout service **automatically partitions the cart into individual vendor-scoped orders**.
- **Immutable Snapshots**: Captures immutable snapshots of shipping addresses and negotiated unit prices at the moment of checkout, protecting against subsequent catalog edits.

### 4. Logistics & Order Fulfillment Lifecycle
- **Order State Machine**: Strict sequential transitions:  
  `PENDING` ➔ `CONFIRMED` ➔ `PROCESSING` ➔ `READY_FOR_SHIPMENT` ➔ `SHIPPED` ➔ `DELIVERED`.
- **Logistics Adapter (`MockLogisticsProvider`)**: Generates airway bills, assigned couriers, and unique tracking identifiers (`TRK-AGRI-...`).
- **Milestone Checkpoint Tracking**: Emits tracking events (`PICKED_UP`, `IN_TRANSIT`, `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`, `DELIVERED`) visualized on an interactive tracking stepper on `/orders/[id]`.

### 5. FPO Aggregation & Bulk Procurement Subsystem
A comprehensive institutional procurement engine designed specifically for Farmer Producer Organisations:
- **FPO Onboarding & Accreditation**: Regulatory onboarding form (`/fpo/register`) and administrative verification queue (`/admin/fpo`).
- **Farmer Membership Management**: Membership application tracking, share capital tracking, and member rosters (`/fpo/join`, `/fpo/dashboard/members`).
- **Crop Commitments**: Individual smallholder farmers commit harvest lots (grade, quantity, target price) to their FPO (`/fpo/commit`).
- **Commercial Lot Aggregation Workbench**: FPO managers pool member commitments into sealed aggregation batches (`/fpo/dashboard/aggregation`).
- **Institutional Buyer RFQs**: Commercial buyers post large-volume purchase requirements (`/fpo/buy-requests`).
- **Algorithmic Lot Matching**: Automatic matching of sealed aggregation batches against open buyer RFQs based on commodity, quantity, and price ceiling.
- **Bulk Order Fulfillment (`orderType: FPO_BULK`)**: Automated bulk order dispatch and delivery tracking.
- **Transparent Settlement Waterfall**: Computes deductions for transport, handling, and FPO commissions, then generates proportional disbursement payout records (`FpoFarmerPayment`) for every contributing farmer (`/fpo/dashboard/settlements`).

### 6. AI Machine Learning Services & Decision Engine
The platform combines machine learning models with a deterministic agronomic decision engine:
- **Dedicated Python FastAPI Microservice (`services/ai`)**:
  - **Price Predictor** (*Random Forest Regressor*): Forecasts APMC modal prices (₹/Quintal) using temporal seasonality, rainfall, and fuel indices without data leakage.
  - **Demand Forecaster** (*Random Forest Regressor*): Forecasts arrival absorption indices and categorizes market liquidity into `HIGH`, `MODERATE`, or `LOW`.
  - **Crop Recommender** (*Random Forest Classifier*): Evaluates soil Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH, temperature, and precipitation to recommend suitable commercial crops across 22 varieties.
- **NestJS Backend Decision Engine (`apps/api/src/ai/decision-engine`)**:
  - **Net Realization Waterfall**: Deducts freight (₹3.50/tonne-km benchmark with fuel adjustments), handling (hamali), weighing fees, packaging, and mandi commission (6%) to calculate net income per channel.
  - **Sell-Timing Advisory**: Compares commodity perishability rates and cold-storage fees against forward price projections to output `SELL NOW` vs `STORE`.
  - **Smart Channel Allocation**: Optimizes volume distribution across Local Mandi, Matched Direct Buyer, and Platform Listing.
  - **Spatial Two-Way Matching**: Computes spherical Haversine distances to match buyer RFQs with nearby farmer harvests.

### 7. Platform Governance & Administration
- **Operational KPI Dashboard**: Real-time platform metrics on active users, listed inventory, total orders, GMV, and pending verifications (`/admin`).
- **Seller & Listing Moderation**: Producer verification workflows, product listing moderation queues, and user report resolution.
- **Immutable Audit Trails**: Tamper-evident, append-only `AuditLog` records tracking actor user ID, IP address, action types, and state changes with foreign-key preservation (`onDelete: SetNull`).
